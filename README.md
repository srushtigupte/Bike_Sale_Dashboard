This Excel project delved into the analysis of bike sales data, utilizing pivot tables and pivot graphs to dissect purchasing behavior across various demographic factors. Through meticulous data organization, three pivot tables were constructed, each shedding light on distinct aspects of the sales landscape: purchase status correlated with commute distance, age brackets, and gender against average income. These pivot tables served as the foundation for a dynamic dashboard featuring pivot graphs. The dashboard showcased critical insights visually, including correlations between average income and gender, customer age brackets, and commute distance, all color-coded to indicate purchase status. Moreover, the integration of slicers enhanced user interactivity, allowing for seamless filtering based on marital status, region, and education level. This project not only provided comprehensive insights into bike sales dynamics but also offered a user-friendly interface for exploring and understanding the data's nuances, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and optimize marketing strategies.
